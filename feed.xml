&lt;p&gt;While discussing IoT at a 2016 World Economic Forum symposium I posited that Apple’s AirPods weren’t mere headphones: they were the first step to a new breed of wearables. Amongst other things, AirPods contain a W1 chip, accelerometers and infrared sensors: these are no mere headphones, they’re a mini-computer. And they’ll increasingly become more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But along with Apple Watch, AirPods aren’t Apple’s only interest in convergence based wearables. Long rumoured to be working on their own version of wearable glasses, here’s what we now know about Apple Iris, working title &lt;em&gt;Project Mirrorshades&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A verified trio of leakers who work within the Taiwanese arm of Hon Hai (Foxconn) and typically sell their reports to KGI leaked the following to /r/apple in a Q&amp;amp;A;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shape: P3, as above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resolution: 428x240 pixels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sound: bone conduction. Zungle have a good example of fashion glasses paired with bone conduction headphones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microphone: akin to AirPods including noise cancellation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sensors: light sensor, accelerometer for step and head tracking, magnetometer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interfaces: voice via Siri as with AirPods, capacitive touch panel on the arm of the frame used for basic touch control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Near-eye-display (NED) sourced from Kopin on the right eye. Future units would offer 2 NEDs, but they’re battery intensive and battery technology is not where it needs to be for 2 to be possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zeiss Smart Optics allowing for the 428x240 ‘screen’ to be projected onto the lenses utilising Fresnel lenses. I’m told that Apple required Zeiss to pull part of this tech from their CES display at the last minute with another company in the HomeKit field facing the same issue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acetate frame as with most fashion glasses. Available in crystal, champagne, and black. Different frame sizes for men and women.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full selling opportunity for Apple; they’ll be available with polarised, clear or prescription lenses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bluetooth Low Energy 5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consumer price point based on BOM: ~US$600&lt;/li&gt;

Where electronics dependent on the iOS ecosystem had once reigned, “Works with Alexa” seemed to be CES 2017’s war cry. No other company nor enjoyed concept so much free advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which led to debates as to whether it’ll last. I was often challenged: are the likes of Alexa, Google Home, and their brethren merely gimmicks? (Thankfully that’s not a direct quote and no one genuinely talks like that.) Will Voice First happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but in limited environments at first. Namely the home and the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to where some people focus the debate, voice is a user interface no more gimmicky than a touchscreen. And it’s an interface that, in a home, is far more natural than a smartphone app. In a car, both more convenient and legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the interface options that exist within a connected home right now for an action as minor as turning on a light;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find your phone, login, open an app, find the relevant app screen, and turn on your lights;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk to your wall switch and turn on you lights;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Say “Alexa, turn on my lights.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is inarguably the easiest and, as IoT devices continue to become commodities, 3 becomes frictionless in comparison to both 1 and 2.
Of course, Voice First has many other areas of consumer appeal apart from smart home control. “Alexa, what’s the traffic like?” “Alexa, play my morning wake up playlist.” “Alexa, text my girlfriend I love her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All easier via voice than via a smartphone app or desktop computer provided, of course, that the surrounds are cohesive to the instruction. All voice commands above are embarrassment free within the context of your home or car, but voice commands issued in a busy, public space won’t always feel so unexceptional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voice First will happen. Voice is our most natural user interface and means of communication, so much so that research firm Gartner predicts that by 2018 some 30% of current touchscreen actions will be performed via voice control instead. That in itself is huge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel P Dykes</name></author><category term="connected-home" /><category term="Amazon" /><summary type="html">This was the first Voice First CES and it’ll be the first of many.

&lt;p&gt;Case in point, Alexa being used in a murder investigation in the USA. There, law enforcement are counting on the fact that Amazon’s storage of all voice conversations it records to Amazon’s servers are not anonymised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s Echo devices and its virtual assistant are meant to help find answers by listening for your voice commands. However, police in Arkansas want to know if one of the gadgets overheard something that can help with a murder case. According to The Information, authorities in Bentonville issued a warrant for Amazon to hand over any audio or records from an Echo belonging to James Andrew Bates. Bates is set to go to trial for first-degree murder for the death of Victor Collins next year…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Police say they were able to pull data off of the speaker, but it’s unclear what info they were able to access. Due to the so-called always on nature of the connected device, the authorities are after any audio the speaker may have picked up that night. &lt;em&gt;– &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/27/amazon-echo-audio-data-murder-case/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Not so from my speech. Instead I talked about an element of IoT that receives far too little attention: convergence and the emergence of the invisible connected-world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/huawei-speech/future-of-iot.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;future of iot&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;IoT isn’t the future. And yet it is.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is the original draft of that speech, re-formatted for a written medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iot-and-smart-homes&quot;&gt;IOT and smart homes.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Economic Forum have labelled connected devices a part of the 4th Industrial Revolution&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That’s in itself is huge. And I’d like to speak to you about that today from the perspective of 10 years of working across the connected home industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 years is how long Aeon Labs have lead the development of smart home accessories. Through a market-ready range of Aeotec products, along with OEM and ODM services, Aeon Labs has engineered, designed and manufactured a range of smart-home products that are now available in over 83 countries. And we’ve designed the products that power IoT’s leading solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/huawei-speech/aeotec-partners.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;aeotec partners&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 years is also how long I’ve worked in the connected-home space. First, introducing wireless, smart home technology into the Australian consumer market. And now, amongst those taking the connected home global.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m speaking to you today from a position of both personal experience, and of Aeon Labs’ decade worth of experience of working at the cutting-edge of the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that, I don’t actually want to talk to you about smart homes. I want to speak about convergence. When I started working in the smart home industry 10 years ago, the term IoT hadn’t even been invented. Neither had the smart phone. 10 years ago, when we wanted to use the Internet we used a computer, we didn’t stream television shows, Wii became a revolution because there was finally a games machine that got children to move more than just their thumbs, and digital compact cameras were fast becoming a best seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/huawei-speech/consumer-electronics.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;consumer electronics&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;‘Recent’ history of electronic consumer goods.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we browse the Internet via our phone, we can binge watch TV shows on our phone, the world’s most popular gaming machine is a phone, and digital compact cameras have all but given way to phones. Naturally, that phone is the smart phone. Convergence. All in one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/huawei-speech/smart-phone-convergence.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;smart phone convergence&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;The result of convergence: everything in one; product definitions blur.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convergence is the future of all useful technology. And it occurs without us even realising. More and more, people don’t even know when they’re using the Internet — in Indonesia, 11% of adults don’t believe that social networking apps use the Internet because they perceive “the Internet” as something you need a computer for&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and you see similar statistics repeated in parts of Africa. So, in their minds, if they’re not using a computer they couldn’t possibly be using the Internet. You and I know differently. We know that apps need data. We know that data pipes across the Internet. And we know that this paradigm shift that people are experiencing is caused by convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/huawei-speech/apps-are-not-the-internet.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;apps are not the internet&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;11% of adults in Indonesia don’t feel that smart phone apps use the Internet for data.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But convergence is more than the future of your phone, the Internet, and the media we consume. It’s the future of your home. Right now, we think of the smart home as something separate. As it’s our own category. As such, the IoT industry sell hubs and accessories. But it won’t be that way for long, because the mass market buys solutions and not gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/huawei-speech/smart-device-penetration.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;smart device market penetration&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;19% of broadband users own a smart device, but 50% want one in a $60 billion market.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home owners don’t want to control their lights from an app, they want real solutions. And there are a lot of solutions that can be addressed: above you can see statistics from the USA where connected people want to actively invest in more connections&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And from research and experience we already know what some of these connected solutions are: people want smart security systems, homes that can take care of their elderly parents, and systems that prevent disasters such as floods and fires&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That is, they want actual solutions and not connected gimmicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/huawei-speech/smart-lighting-market-share.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;smart lighting market share&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Only 30% of people want app driven lighting control.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But instead of impactful solutions, smart home offerings to date have largely focussed on controlling your home from an app — and let’s face it, most apps are little more than a complication of the user experience that a light switch already offers. For most people, controlling your lights from an app isn’t an enhancement, it’s a pain. Hence companies working at the cutting edge of the connected home, such as Aeon Labs and Huawei, are shifting their focus from attention grabbing devices to solutions that actually deliver on what consumers want. As Wayne Gretzky quoted, and Steve Jobs popularised, we’re “skating to where the puck is going to be” and not to where IoT used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security and safety are the first wave of mass adopted IoT. That’s how convergence works. In waves, where two existing ideas come together to create something new. The mobile phone and the Internet come together to create the smart phone, and a decade later the smart phone and home security are coming together to create the smart security system. And we know that more than 50% of homeowners want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/huawei-speech/smart-security-system-market-size.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;smart security system market size&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;The size of the smart security system market in the USA.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only 5% currently own one. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because so few companies offer them. And that’s where opportunity exists. Convergence creates 2 things: disruption and opportunity. Amongst the audience today are people from telephone and utility companies — these are companies that don’t traditionally offer security solutions. And I’d like to ask, why not? After all, smart security systems are a connectivity service, and service providers excel at providing connectivity — that’s what people trust service providers to do — to keep them connected to something. And soon, as long as the provider has the right solution, consumers will trust their service providers to keep more and more parts of their home and life fully connected. And if the companies they trust fail to keep up, consumers will simply find new service providers. Because just as disruption provides industries with new opportunities, so too does it destroy established players in the market who fail to keep up. As Uber laid waste to taxi companies globally, so too shall IoT lay waste to service providers who fail to offer the connected solutions that people want to benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see that I keep using the word “solution.” and that’s why I didn’t want to talk you about the “smart home” today. Because smart home is a loaded phrase. You think of it and you think of connected lighting and a coffee machine that makes a terrible cup of coffee before you wake up each morning. If a solution tells you about how it makes your morning coffee, it’s failed. Because consumers want real benefits, and consumer demand, along with all these new technologies, is what’s driving the convergence and disruption that we can build the 4th industrial revolution upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what kind of opportunities are there in the 4th industrial revolution? Well I’ve already touched on just how big an opportunity smart home security is and how non-traditional players can offer it. But think of other industries that are on the verge of change and disruption because of the Internet of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/huawei-speech/smart-home-device-wants.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;smart home device consumer demand&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;What people want from the Internet of Things and their smart homes.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insurance industry. In home care. The aging population and the silver tidal wave. Connected cars and transport. Each of these are entire industries that typically offer the world little in technological innovation when it comes to connectivity. And yet each of them aren’t only going to come to depend on connected devices, the people who use their products are going to demand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave us all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back where the smart home and the Internet of Things should always have started. With real solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

Once truly connected homes move past the stage of early adoption, you’ll hear much about privacy and security. The privacy of who can tap into your home’s data to know what you’re doing and when you’re home. The security of preventing hackers from being able to hack into your home. The senationalist press will wax lyrical about hackers being able to open your front door or watch you while you’re sleeping like some perverted Santa Claus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IoT security and IoT privacy will become their own subindustries. They’re also going to become passion projects, akin to open-source projects such as Home Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an area that few people are paying attention to, Tor is &lt;a href=&quot;https://home-assistant.io/cookbook/tor_configuration/&quot;&gt;amongst the first out of the gate&lt;/a&gt;. Now your connected home can live on the dark web (alongside arms and drug dealers). It’s still far too complex for the average home owner to setup, but so are most IoT offerings in spite of the industry’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;

Once truly connected homes move past the stage of early adoption, you’ll hear much about privacy and security. The privacy of who can tap into your home’s data to know what you’re doing and when you’re home. The security of preventing hackers from being able to hack into your home. The senationalist press will wax lyrical about hackers being able to open your front door or watch you while you’re sleeping like some perverted Santa Claus.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Robots and the convergence of the connected home and AI.</title><link href="https://danielpdykes.com/connected-home/smart-home-robots.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Robots and the convergence of the connected home and AI." /><published>2016-06-21T16:33:36+01:00</published><updated>2016-06-21T16:33:36+01:00</updated><id>https://danielpdykes.com/connected-home/smart-home-robots</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://danielpdykes.com/connected-home/smart-home-robots.html">&lt;p&gt;One of the largest problems facing the adoption of the connected-home is that the category doesn’t necessarily provide owners with a lot of value. The typical smart home system is sold with a pitch of “your home on your phone.” Most of us don’t need that. We don’t need to install a $3,000 connected-home system when our light switches work just fine. We don’t need to spend money to do something that we can already do and do easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why IoT and security systems are such great bedfellows: the former enhances the latter, and the latter provides real value that home owners are actively looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To succeed, IoT needs to bring obvious value. For those looking at the eventual convergence of IoT and AI, keep an eye on the likes of OpenAI, a non-profit backed by the likes of Elon Musk. One of OpenAI’s stated goals is to create a platform that could power a robot “to perform basic housework” chores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence. Outcome. Benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all things connected-home, it would start out slow. We’re years away from robots handling our chores to the degree of Rosie in The Jetsons. But with the likes of Roomba already popular, and the ability to really revolutionise the other dull household chores that all detract from quality of life, the potential is there. And so are most of the gadgets already. We just have to intelligently connect them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel P Dykes</name></author><category term="connected-home" /><category term="apple" /><category term="privacy" /><category term="voice" /><summary type="html">One of the largest problems facing the adoption of the connected-home is that the category doesn’t necessarily provide owners with a lot of value.

WWDC is a software event, and new hardware is rarely seen. Hence we’re yet to see &lt;a href=&quot;/connected-home/presence-detection-home-control.html&quot;&gt;Apple’s rumoured Amazon Echo killer&lt;/a&gt;. And yet we may have already seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confused?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WWDC focusses on the repurposing of existing Apple hardware and the extension of that hardware’s existing features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why it struck me in the lead up to WWDC that Apple didn’t actually have to release any hardware dedicated to HomeKit to heavily enter the smart home space. All they had to do was begin to repurpose the devices we already own. And we saw the first steps of that in their iOS driven HomeKit app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a smart home an app does not make. A smart home needs a hub in order to be smart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does Apple build a HomeKit driven smart home when few people own their most hub-like device, an Apple TV? By repurposing the other device that most of us already have;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That previous-gen, unused iPad that you have laying around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/apple-ipad-homekit-gateway.png&quot; alt=&quot;apple homekit gateway&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come September, when iOS 10 is released, your old iPad will be repurposed as an always-connected, smart home hub. One that drives HomeKit and a host of other smart features, including impeccible voice control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has always been great at creating multi-purpose products. A lot of them have been trojan products; one thing today, another, even more advanced thing a year later when its new OS is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your old iPad is such a trojan product, and it just became the smart home hub that you didn’t know you already had.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel P Dykes</name></author><category term="connected-home" /><category term="apple" /><category term="privacy" /><category term="voice" /><summary type="html">The fact that WWDC 2016 didn’t reveal any new Apple hardware doesn’t mean that we actually haven’t seen any presented to us.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/smart-home-emotion-recognition.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Smart home emotion analysis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emotient is one of Apple’s most recent purchases. Inking the deal at the start of 2016, Emotient will allow Apple to achieve something seemingly magical: it’ll allow Apple hardware, with Siri as the potential UI, to interpret the 43 muscles in your face. And from those, it’ll be able to work out who you are and what you’re feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Emotient is the leading authority on facial expression recognition and analysis technologies that are enabling a future of emotion aware computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple have bought heavily into this space of late. The application for home control is obvious: its killer app. Emotient’s technology could figure into the rumoured Amazon Echo killer, and it could also come to power new iOS APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could also power entirely new categories for the company beyond home control. Consider their other purchases of PrimeSense and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34920548&quot;&gt;FaceShift&lt;/a&gt;, a company whose software allows 3D animated characters to mimic the facial expressions of an actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more here brewing than just a new entry into the field that Amazon Echo and Google Home are both trying to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel P Dykes</name></author><category term="connected-home" /><category term="apple" /><summary type="html">If you want an insight into what Apple may be cooking for home control without all the marketing gloss that Apple will end up giving it, then reading Brian Roemmele’s background piece on Emotient is well worth the investment of 10 or so minutes to read.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Don’t overlook Apple’s other buyout and its impact upon a truly smart home.</title><link href="https://danielpdykes.com/connected-home/apple-microsoft-kinect.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Don’t overlook Apple’s other buyout and its impact upon a truly smart home." /><published>2016-05-28T16:33:36+01:00</published><updated>2016-05-28T16:33:36+01:00</updated><id>https://danielpdykes.com/connected-home/apple-microsoft-kinect</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://danielpdykes.com/connected-home/apple-microsoft-kinect.html">&lt;p&gt;The riff that &lt;a href=&quot;https://danielpdykes.com/connected-home/apple-ai-privacy.html&quot;&gt;Apple doesn’t get AI&lt;/a&gt; overlooks their ability to buy cutting-edge tech, to acquihire, and then to never say a word about it for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some companies that we know they’ve bought that figure into their AI, Siri, and voice UI ambitions. And we can draw conclusions as to what that means: Apple products not just on your person, but controlling your personal space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in each pundits’ run to make sense of Apple’s rumoured “Amazon Echo killer” most have overlooked one confirmed purchase. In 2013 Apple purchased PrimeSense. They’re the company responsible for the 3D sensor that made Microsoft’s Kinect possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, with Apple TV the only obvious product to associate it with, most analysts postulated that Apple’s purchase of PrimeSense figured into their ambitions within the home entertainment space, that it would be utilised as some kind of ‘wave your hand and control your TV’ novelty. PrimeSense’s tech will probably come to have an impact on your in-home entertainment. But don’t sell it short. Apple are great at making multifunctional devices. iPhone doesn’t sell in great volume merely because it’s a phone, nor did Apple Watch outsell Rolex because it tells you the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And where might PrimeSense’s 3D spacial technology have its biggest impact? Think of in-home control. A system that knows who you are and in which room of your house you’re in. A system that can control your home’s entertainment system accordingly. A system that can control every HomeKit connected-device in your house. And one that processes everything locally and privately. That wouldn’t kill Amazon Echo — it’d be more expensive — but it would innovate right past it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gem is that Apple wouldn’t even be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://danielpdykes.com/connected-home/presence-detection-home-control.html&quot;&gt;first people to attempt to use PrimeSense’s technology&lt;/a&gt; to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel P Dykes</name></author><category term="connected-home" /><category term="apple" /><summary type="html">The riff that Apple doesn’t get AI overlooks their ability to buy cutting-edge tech, to acquihire, and then to never say a word about it for years to come.</summary></entry></feed>
